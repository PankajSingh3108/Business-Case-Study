# E-Commerce Sales Drop â€“ Business Analyst Case Study

## Problem Statement

ShopKart, a mid-sized e-commerce platform, experienced a 15% drop in sales over the past 3 months year-over-year. Key indicators include:

- Conversion rate declined from 2.8% to 2.1%
- Average order value (AOV) dropped from $75 to $70
- Customer complaints increased by 25%
- A new website version was launched 4 months ago
- A major competitor launched a discount campaign

## Hypotheses

2. Competitor discounts are attracting price-sensitive customers
3. Checkout process has become complex or buggy
4. Customer dissatisfaction has increased, impacting repeat sales
5. Product pricing is no longer competitive

- Customer Feedback: Analyze complaint categories, sentiment trends

## Key Findings (Simulated)

- Increased cart abandonment due to additional steps in checkout
- Mobile users experience more issues compared to desktop

- Common complaints include navigation issues and failed payments

## Recommendations
